# Fight COVID UK Frontend repo

Big apologies if this is messy. I'm a (very) junior engineer with only a few weeks of coding, and I guess it doesn't help that an alarming proportion of this was codebase was developed in the early hours of the morning ;]

I haven't had much / any time for cleanup, but if you're familiar with react / typescript, you should hopefully be able to work out what's going on.

I've given a very high-level and overly brief overview below.

Best of luck!

## Stack

* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) builder with dev and prod modes, devserver and analysis
* [Ant Design](https://ant.design) with ANTD icons import mitigation
* React 16 (hooks, functional components) framework
* Typescript
* ESLint
* Prettier
* React Router
* Static main HTML file
* Single page app. Static JS bundles (main, react, antd, vendors)
* Less CSS
* Firebase serverless backend with the JS/Web SDK


## Super rough overview of the frontend:
Our "root" component is App. Within App, we provide 6 contexts:
1. FirestoreContext
2. AuthHookContext
3. CurrentUserInfoContext
4. ProjectSignatureContext
5. VolunteerSignatureContext 
6. AnalytcsContext

This architecture prevents the overfetching of data - to an extent![1] Components listen to single/centralised context values provided 
here rather than being responsible for fetching data themselves. 

There is still a ton of overfetching, but it isn't so bad.

In general, there is probably a framework to use here, but I just hacked this together expediently. (Redux is pretty bloated and verbose, so I avoided it.)


Right now, everything is just client side. We fetch 'signatures' from firebase (userSig, projectSig) which are used for
pagination-like behaviour and filtering. These are pretty small (~50b for project sigs , ~66b for vol sigs when compressed), so
for a few hundred projects / volunteers, it's fine to send them all to the client; for larger numbers, this must be moved
server-side.

Throughout the codebase, we don't listen to context values directly, only through certain hooks.
--- e.g:
```javascript
useFirestore: () => undefined | firebase.firestore.Firestore = () => {
  return useContext(FirestoreContext);
};
```

Following App's children, the next most significant component is probably AppContextSwitcher. This component selectively renders the pages depending on the
routes; it allows us to not reload the entire page. We have a route-mapping.tsx file which maps routes to react components (and other metadata).

The route stuff is pretty hacky. 

## Installation / starting up.

For local dev :

1. Download
2. run yarn
3. yarn start for dev mode

Firebase will have to be set up to use real users / data. You'll need entries for:

Analytics, Auth and 
Firestore with docs for userSigs, users, projectSigs, projectIds, projects.
